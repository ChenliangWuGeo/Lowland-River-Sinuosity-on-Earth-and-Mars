# Lowland-River-Sinuosity-on-Earth-and-Mars

Code of figures presented in "Pace of meandering and avulsion set lowland river sinuosity on Earth and Mars" a paper in review at Nature Geoscience by Wu et al.

Figures 2 to 4 from the manuscript and be reproduced by running the scripts fig2ab.m, fig2cd.m, fig3.m and fig4.m.

The file modernRiver.mat stores river centerlines, calculated sinuosity, river kilometers, etc.

The code batchRun.m can be used to reproduce the simulation results for 1000 river planform development in figure 3, which is stored as Result1000.mat.

arrow.m, Mann_Kendall.m, Violin.m and violinplot.m are downloaded from file exchange.
